# VBA-Stock-Analysis-Challenge
Analysis of stock data to identify high and low performing stocks

My Excel dataset contains stock price information from the years 2018,2019 and 2020. VBA was used to analyse the data and highlight some key statistics related to stock performance over the aforementioned years.

After running the VBA script, the spreadsheet shows the yearly change for each stock for each of the three years under review as well as the total volume traded. positive changes in stock values over the year are highlighted in green while negative changes are highlighted in red.

I also isolated the stocks with the greatest percentage increase for the year in question and the greatest percentage decrease, as well as highest volume traded. Summary tables of these results are shown below:
